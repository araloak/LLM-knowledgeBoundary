# Perception of Knowledge Boundaries for LLMs via Semi-open-ended Question Answering

This repository contains code for generating semi-open-ended questions and  answers from GPT-4. Besides, we provide questions and answers we obtained in our experiments with corresponding labels.

Please carefully use the data in this package as theyâ€™re AI-generated contents that may contain hallucinations. We highly recommend you to carefully examine the truthfulness of each answer before accepting it.
